# Credit Score Classification - Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for credit score classification using a structured dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, multiple models, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluations.

## Dataset Used:
You can find the dataset used on Kaggle here:

## Project Contents:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships.

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and managing outliers.

- Feature Engineering: Label encoding, one-hot encoding, and resampling to address class imbalance.

## Models Implemented:

- Tree-Based Models: CatBoost (w/ and w/o tuning), XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest (w/ and w/o tuning)
- Non-Tree-Based Models: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
  
## Model Tuning: 
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## Model Evaluation: 
Visualizations including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and classification reports.
